# BeamMeshGenerator

## Description

This mesh generator object generates a 1D mesh from a input mesh text file that has two different sections `# Nodes` and `# Element Linear`. Each row following `# Nodes` corresponds to one node and it should contain the node id, x, y and z coordinates of the node, and any nodesets that this node belongs to. Each row following `# Element Linear` corresponds to one  Edge2 element and it should contain the element id, node ids of the two nodes that this element connects, and the block id that this element belongs to.

!alert! note
- Only first order 1D elements can currently be generated by this object.
- The mesh generated can be refined using the `uniform_refine` parameter in the Mesh block or using the adaptive meshing block.
- The rows following `# Nodes` should contain atleast 4 entries corresponding to node id, x, y and z coordinates.
- The rows following `# Element Linear` should contain only 4 entries corresponding to element id, node 0, node 1 and block id.
- Node and element numbering starts with zero.
